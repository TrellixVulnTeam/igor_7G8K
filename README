Ingredients
-----------
- Working cobbler environment
- libvirt
- python
-- python-bottle (bottlepy)
-- libvirt-python

Overview
--------
Basically a daemon prepares hosts and tells cobbler what profile to assign to 
them.
Afterwards it is expected that a client script is run by the host to run a 
number of testcases (structured into testsuites, testsets and testcases).

Getting started
---------------
$ sudo yum install -y python-bottle libvirt-python
